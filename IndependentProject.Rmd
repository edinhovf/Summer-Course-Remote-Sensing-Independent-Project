## R Markdown information

## This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## When you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# This is the 'setup' code chunk that tells the document whether to include anything from your code chunks in the output (knitted) document. "include=FALSE"" says "don't include code in my output".
# You can also load R packages here. I've added the tidyverse package already since it's very useful, and you can insert here any other packages you eventually need for your analyses.

## Summary

Measurement (area and color intensity) of a sand patch adjacent to a tide pool which we've been monitoring coral health for the last 2 years. This measurement will be a proxy of potential of burial for those corals and will be correlated to the percentage of coral bleached area.

## Question(s)

Insert here the specific, testable question(s) your project seeks to answer.

* Question 1: Are the measurements (area and color intensity) obtained from satellite imagery of an adjacent sand patch correlated to the visual estimate registered in the tide pool in situ?
* Question 2: Is there a correlation between the measurements of sand in the adjacent area obtained by satellite imagery and the percentage of coral bleached area in the tide pool?

## Introduction

Global changes are the main threat to corals in a global scale. Commonly, the increase of temperature leads to bleaching, however other stressing factors may also result in such outcome. We've noticed in a tide pool that has been monitored for 2 years now that the percentage of coral bleaching is not necessarily correlated to the increase in temperature, but rather may be guided by the increase of the amount of sand inside the tide pool, which consequently may cover the corals.

## Methods

* Measurement of the sand patch area on Planet.com every month from May 2017 to April 2019
* Collection of monthly screenshots on Planet.com centered in the sand patch adjacent to the tide pool (maximum zoom in - sacle bar=50m)
* Editing of each screenshot drawing a line that determine the area to be measured - equal area and shape for all screenshots
* Determination of the white scale measuring the color intensity of an area defined over the white part of the wave in front of the sand patch - performed in Image J
* Measurement of the color intensity of the whole area of the patch sand determined before
* Correlations between:
  + area and color intensity
  + area and field percentage of burial
  + color intensity and field percentage of burial
  + area and field percentage of bleached area
  + color intensity and field percentage of bleached area

## Results

All the areas were already measured and the screenshots collected and edited. The measurements of white scale were all performed and the color intensity of the sand patch area is being conducted


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#(Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot, but this can be changed if, for example, you want to share both your code and your plots with collaborators in early stages of a manuscript.)

#You would also do your analyses in this section, and you can choose whether or not your code and analytical results show up in the output (knitted) document, for example (replace this with your own when you're ready to do analyses):
```


## Discussion

* Using satellite imagery may be very useful to obtain data for sand coming in and out from the tide pool during the year
* Merging satellite imagery collection (Planet.com), image editing (Photoshop) and image analysis (Image J) is quite useful and fun
* Difficulties: selection of the area to be measured in Image J - takes a bit long to do that
